# DevDojo

**DevDojo** is a comprehensive learning and experimentation hub featuring a wide range of backend microservices built using various programming languages, frameworks, and technologies. This repository aims to provide developers—from beginners to seasoned professionals—a platform to explore, understand, and implement modern backend architectures and best practices.

## What is DevDojo?

DevDojo is a polyglot environment where you can find multiple microservices, each implemented in a different language and framework. Whether you’re interested in Java, Kotlin, Go, C#, Python, or simply curious about microservices architecture, DevDojo serves as an open playground. Here, you can study the code, test features, and experiment with configurations, all while learning the nuances of different tech stacks.

## Key Features

- **Polyglot Services:**  
  Each directory hosts a microservice built in a different language and technology stack. Examples include:
    - **Java (Spring Boot)**: RESTful API demonstrating typical MVC patterns and DI.
    - **Kotlin (Spring Boot)**: A service showcasing Kotlin’s concise syntax and Spring Boot’s rapid development features.
    - **Go (Gin)**: A high-performance service built with Gin, illustrating Go’s simplicity, concurrency, and speed.
    - **C# (.NET)**: A microservice running on .NET Core, showing C#’s powerful features and compatibility across platforms.
    - **Python (Django)**: A service leveraging Django’s batteries-included philosophy for rapid API development.

- **Microservices Architecture Best Practices:**  
  Learn how microservices communicate, discover service boundaries, and implement APIs that are independently deployable, scalable, and maintainable.

- **Infrastructure & DevOps Integration:**  
  See examples of containerization (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes), and CI/CD pipelines. Understand how different services fit into the DevOps lifecycle.

- **Security & Observability:**  
  Explore common security patterns (JWT, OAuth2) and tools for monitoring and logging (Prometheus, ELK stack, Grafana), ensuring each service is not only functional but also secure and observable in production environments.

```

- **Language-Specific Directories:** Each service directory contains all the source code, configuration files, and a dedicated README to explain setup, running, and testing instructions for that particular service.
- **Docs & Architecture:** The `docs/` folder may include architectural diagrams, notes, and guides on how to deploy or integrate these services with other systems.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/DevDojo.git
   cd DevDojo
   ```

2. **Prerequisites:**
    - **General:** Docker, Docker Compose (if you’re planning to run services in containers)
    - **Language-Specific:**
        - Java & Kotlin: JDK 11+
        - Go: Go 1.18+
        - C#: .NET 6+
        - Python: Python 3.9+ and `pipenv` or `virtualenv`

3. **Running a Service:**
   Each service directory includes its own README with step-by-step instructions. For example:
    - **Java (Spring Boot)**:
      ```bash
      cd java-springboot-service
      ./mvnw spring-boot:run
      ```
    - **Go (Gin)**:
      ```bash
      cd go-gin-service
      go run cmd/main.go
      ```

   Follow similar instructions for other services.

4. **Testing & Validation:**
   Most services come with their own test suites. Run them according to the instructions in the respective service’s README.

## Learning Objectives

- **Compare & Contrast Technologies:**  
  Understand the strengths and trade-offs of different programming languages and frameworks.

- **Microservices Principles:**  
  Gain hands-on experience with concepts like domain-driven design, distributed tracing, circuit breakers, and service discovery.

- **Practical DevOps:**  
  Learn how to containerize your services, configure CI/CD pipelines, and deploy to different environments.

- **Security & Stability:**  
  Explore best practices in authentication, authorization, and monitoring to keep services reliable and secure.
